# Weather Dashboard
## The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for the weather forecast of cities and view a 5-day weather forecast. This README provides an overview of the project and its components.

# Features
## City Search: Users can enter the name of a city and click the "Search" button to retrieve the weather forecast for that city.

City List: The application maintains a list of cities that the user has searched for. This list is displayed on the left side of the interface.

Weather Details: When a city is selected from the list, the right side of the interface displays the name of the city and the current weather details for that city.

5-Day Weather Forecast: Below the weather details, there is a section that displays a 5-day weather forecast. Each day's forecast is displayed in a separate container.

# Project Structure
## The project is structured as follows:

HTML: The index.html file contains the structure of the web page, including the input field, buttons, and containers for displaying weather information.

CSS: The style.css file contains the styles for the web page, including the layout, colors, and formatting of various elements.

JavaScript: The script.js file contains the JavaScript code that handles user interactions, makes API requests to retrieve weather data, and updates the interface with the retrieved data.

Dependencies: The project uses the Day.js library for date and time manipulation. The library is included via a CDN link in the HTML file.
